partners ccep one year ago two motivations propelled me first i wanted to grow this new company in a way that ful lled its potential while respecting its shared heritage second i wanted to do it in a way that would make me proud along with all our employees and every one of our stakeholders we have created the worldtms largest cocacola bottler and put sustainability in its broadest sense at the heart of the business from our earliest days ccep established strong fundamentals about how we hold ourselves accountable to each other and to the outside world and how we create an environment where people want to work and believe in what we are doing we also developed an operating model that better re ects how people choose to enjoy and buy our beverages and now the next phase begins over the past year we have seized the chance to talk to people about what they expect from this new company that has such deep roots with our colleagues at the cocacola company we have listened to customers consumers employees and our leadership about the issues facing our business and the wider world and what is expected from us the feedback was clear you want us fundamentally to be a good business but one that more meaningfully in uences some of the biggest issues we face as a society you want to see us taking a lead on our packaging the sugar and calories in our beverages and the impact we have on our communities we are hard at work transforming these expectations into a set of targets and commitments that we will publish this autumn this will be our rst sustainability strategy for the cocacola system in western europe but rst we had to know where we were coming from with three merging bottling organisations it has taken us a year to consolidate our data to establish the baseline for our rst

environmental performance from transforming our drinks portfolio and packaging to diversity i am proud that we have been able to do so much since forming ccep the credit for the progress in this

the world and we take pride in our many social initiatives big and small and how ptc has helped make a better tomorrow at both a local and global level our world is transforming the physical and digital worlds are coming togetherconvergingand within this new reality there are limitless opportunities to create powerful change this convergence aligns directly with our business capabilities which help improves companies operations better their products and empower their people think for example of the efficiency unlocked as the world moves from unconnected private cars barely utilized each day to networked carsharing where automobiles experience a radically higher rate of utilization or imagine a child putting on augmented reality ar glasses thinking they are playing a game and then realizing how they turn bits and bytes into sounds and sights that could make them more productive at almost anything they do it is this type of empowerment of both machines and people that is at the core of who we are and what we doweve long supported stem programs like first for inspiration and recognition of science and technology and others like it that inspire and educate a new generation of children to become exposed to and passionate about technology at an early age not only do we help increase the odds that childrenespecially girls and underrepresented minoritiesmight turn to a career in engineering to make the world a better place but in so doing we expose all program participants to our company and its amazing technology we also create shared value when we look for ways to improve the efficiency of our own operations such as our headquarters move to an awardwinning leed platinum certified building in the seaport district of boston that lessens our environmental footprint we are proud of ptcs long work in csr and will continue to pursue the different aspects of our program with alignment around one important idea our greatest social responsibility is to create technology inspiration in the communities around us in ways that increase our companys value to all stakeholders sincerely jim heppelmannpresident and ceo ptccompage ptc has been an active and

frederickpolls give us valuable feedback on our mission of providing customers with energy thats affordable reliable and increasingly cleanresidents in the states we serve consider reliability and reasonable cost to be the two most important factors when it comes to electricity in addition a vast majority of respondents said they support retiring and replacing aging power plants with newer more modern technologythe surveys also reveal a growing belief that rising demand for electricity can be met through conservation rather than by building more power plants another popular option generating electricity from renewable resources like wind and solar energy however survey results indicate that respondents may not necessarily be aware of the higher costs associated with renewable power compared to generation from traditional fuels like coal nuclear and natural gashere are a few additional conclusions from the surveys in the carolinas almost percent of respondents expressed support for the continued construction of our new megawatt mw advanced pulverizedcoal unit at the cliffside steam station approximately percent of south carolinians polled support our proposed mw william

our perspective is informed by our experience with sustainability issues in the energy sector knowledge of reporting best practices and familiarity with duke energys reporting approach over the past four years it should be noted that this review neither verifies nor expresses an opinion on the accuracy materiality or completeness of information provided in this reportkey strengths we observed in the report include a truly integrated approach to reporting that more effectively capitalizes on the unique strengths of print and online media use of web content for background information detailed treatment of key issues illustrative cases and interactive features allow for more focused communication of performance on material issues in the printed report while maintaining the option for readers to dive into greater depth online updates provide timely information throughout the year and social media establish new avenues for dialogue visual prompts such as the computer mouse icon and callout boxes in the printed version effectively bridge the two formats and emphasize their complementary nature open discussion of lessons learned and unresolved challenges constructing a path toward a lowercarbon energy portfolio in a climate of technological and regulatory uncertainty is challenging inclusion of insights from the companys energy efficiency initiative and discussion of low consumer investment in renewable energy programs demonstrate transparency and balanced treatment of learning and failure as well as success along the way enhancement of stakeholder voices our last two reviews highlighted inclusion of stakeholder voices as a key area for improvement we saw multiple examples in this years report that fulfill this objective interviews with senior management the five viewpoints dialogue and the reprint of the rmi case study we hope to see duke energy continue this practice in future reports and to refine its use to share new insights and critical perspectivesin next years report we encourage duke energy to better track and explain evolving strategies and targets duke energys sustainability goals are aspirational and the specific strategies and targets set to reach them should evolve over time to reflect the realities of implementation and spur continuous improvement acknowledging this the company has refined the objectives that support its goals over the past three years most notably its carbonreduction scenario however the report did not provide sufficient information about the status of previous objectives or the rationale behind new objectives and revised targets continuity between reports is critical to communicating a picture of performance and ties together past and present achievement with a roadmap for the future report holistically and concretely on climate policy advocacy failure to reach an international agreement on carbon reduction at copenhagen and a growing sense of urgency around advancement of climate change legislation at the national level are renewing stakeholder interest in businesss role in policy advocacy leading practice in reporting is also evolving to better capture the full spectrum of companies contributions to policy development including technical input to policy design and implementation education to raise voter awareness and legal briefs along with traditional measures such as financial support for candidates and lobbying while the current report articulates duke energys priorities for national climate legislation more holistic communication of duke energys specific engagement activities will be of particular interest in the coming year address potential adverse environmental impacts of new renewable energy technologies specifically biomass and offshore wind development direct discussion of actual or potential impacts will enhance public understanding of the tradeoffs associated with these lesserknown technologies and allow comparison with other energy generation optionswe enter with considerable uncertainty for the energy industry in the united states economic legislative and technological what is certain is the critical role that sustainability will play in navigating the decisions necessary to move toward a lowcarbon energy future and longterm business success we look forward to learning how duke energy is charting its course in future reportsjulia kaiulani

credits could recur marktomarket adjustments reflect the marktomarket impact of derivative contracts which is recognized in gaap earnings immediately as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory accounting used in duke energys hedging of a portion of the economic value of certain of its generation assets in the commercial power segment the economic value of the generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities eg coal power and as such the economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to the generation assets because the operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method management believes that excluding the impact of marktomarket changes of the economic hedge contracts from adjusted earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the hedge contract with the portion of the economic value of the underlying hedged asset management believes that the presentation of adjusted diluted eps provides useful information to investors as it provides them an additional relevant

diversity duke energytms overall supply chain includes more than suppliers of nonfuel materials and services mostly from domestic sources the company spends about billion annually which includes capital expenditures on new power plant construction and other major projects our expenditures are split fairly equally between services and materialsequipment purchases diverse suppliers bring great value to duke energy and the communities we serve diverse suppliers include businesses owned by minorities women or veterans servicedisabled veterans and those located in historically underutilized business zones hubzones our total spend excluding fuel has decreased about billion over the past three years with a million decrease in alone this is primarily because of the completion of several large construction projects the decrease has negatively affected our spend with duke energy l governance and transparency diverse suppliers which fell in for the first time in several years however spend with diverse suppliers as a percentage of total spend continued to increase rising from about percent in to percent in we work proactively to build relationships with current diverse suppliers as well as identify new suppliers for example in we served as the host sponsor of the th annual energizing powerful connections conference in charlotte north carolina along with four other utilities we provided networking opportunities for utilityexperienced diverse suppliers we also encourage our tier i suppliers to focus on and engage with diverse suppliers as a result of this and other efforts

poles and other waste wood into electricity creating a recycling effort that is truly full circle duke energy purchases about wooden utility poles annually a vital component in delivering electricity to customers over time those poles need replacing so what happens to the old poles and other wood waste in the past a small portion of the material was donated or reused but more than percent of our tons of waste wood was sent to landfills every year duke energy now contracts with a vendor national salvage and service to collect and repurpose or recycle wood waste from most of our service territories today about percent of the wood is repurposed as wood products poles fence posts and pallets and percent is shredded and used as fuel for electricity generation leaving less than percent of our wood waste for disposal in landfills in the carolinas wood that cannot be repurposed is shredded at a new facility near goldsboro north carolina the area has suffered from high unemployment and this facility has created muchneeded jobs for the community the shredded wood is trucked to a biomass plant where it is burned to generate electricity in most cases the power is sold to you guessed it

adjusted diluted eps is a nongaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measure as it represents diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to duke energy corporation common shareholders adjusted for the pershare impact of special items and the marktomarket impacts of economic hedges in the commercial power segment special items represent certain charges and credits which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis although it is reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur marktomarket adjustments reflect the marktomarket impact of derivative contracts which is recognized in gaap earnings immediately as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory accounting used in duke energytms hedging of a portion of the economic value of certain of its generation assets in the commercial power segment the economic value of the generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities eg coal power and as such the economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those commodities because the operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method management believes that excluding the impact of marktomarket changes for the economic hedge contracts from adjusted earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the hedge contract with the portion of the economic value of the underlying hedged asset management believes that the presentation of adjusted diluted eps provides useful information to investors as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of the companytms performance across periods adjusted diluted eps is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses the most directly comparable gaap measure for adjusted diluted eps is reported diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to duke energy corporation common shareholders which includes

and our ability to make a positive impact on the world we do this in part through our focused sustainability efforts many of which ive had the opportunity to experience firsthand this past year in june for example i saw our commitment to inclusion and diversity in action while marching with the qualcomm team in san diegos annual lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt pride parade later in the year we at qualcomm had our own moment of pride when we learned we scored percent on the human rights campaigns corporate equality index for the third yearin september i had the privilege of

help increase the numbers of women in science technology engineering and math stem careers and how specifically we can increase the numbers of women who work and lead at qualcomm i also paid visits to our newly formed very handson thinkabit lab designed to inspire school kids to pursue stem careers the lab reminds me of why i became an engineer in the first placethroughout the year i was eager to share with our industry and communities what we call transformative technologyour breakthrough innovations that are contributing to our companys growth while helping to make cities transportation education and health care more sustainable for example through our smart cities initiative were reimagining the role of technology and connectivity in todays cities inventing solutions for

management approach and standard disclosures otherwise referred to as performance indicators referenced through the qualcomm social responsibility qsr report this assurance applies to the report based on the fiscal year made public in april of it does not extend to events occurring prior to or after the reporting cycle a verification statement will be made public and submitted to the global reporting initiative the scope of the assurance covers the economic social and environmental performance data both quantitatively and qualitatively expressed on behalf of qualcomms headquarters and subsidiaries this assurance exercise has been conducted by verifying report content and supporting documentation made available during the external assurance period march march the scope of the assurance does not include observational analysis as a component of onsite visits but rather a strict emphasis on the reliability and quality of report content in addition to verification of data sources and collection processes the comprehensive assessment and summary that accompany this formal statement are to be used at the discretion of qualcomm it is the companys decision to implement suggestions made by isos group in future reporting cycles our methodology basis of our work and level of assurance isos group administered the assurance process for qualcomm through its experts who followed the g framework established by the global reporting initiative and principles for defining report content and ensuring the quality of the reported information while integrating selfdeveloped tools for verification of sustainability reporting based on practices drawn from the un global compact the djsi aa relevant iso series and anticipated developments in this field this external assurance exercise consists of four main tasks and two supplemental ones performance results are determined by isos groups evaluation of reported information which is weighted and scored additionally corporate codes and policies driving organizational change data justifications supplied by key personnel internal stakeholder feedback and statements made by key members of the reporting team during process interviews are referred to as support for claims made by the company an acceptable score indicated by a threshold is needed for the four main tasks in order to issue a level although only twenty material indicators are required for a gri b level report this external assurance statement is based on the results of a comprehensive verification of all disclosed indicators while highlighting performance of a preselected sample of twenty indicators what we did key assurance procedures isos group administered the assurance process for qualcomm through its experts who strictly followed the g framework along with the global reporting initiatives principles for defining report content and ensuring the quality of the reported information while integrating independently developed tools for verification our findings were supported by conducting an inspection of the documentation used for gathering analyzing and aggregating the material quantitative data investigation of procedures for determining material inclusiveness via random sampling and interviews and inquiries of the central unit responsible for preparing the report as well as a select group of internal and external stakeholders an initial review allowed for the company to make adjustments to detected discrepancies and deliver supplemental data to support their case once a final draft was delivered to isos groups assurance practitioners elements of each main task credibility check quantitative review qualitative review and sustainability action balance were carefully evaluated and weighted accordingly external assurance statement by isos group llc to qualcomm incorporated qsr report gri application level b approved what we found our assurance opinion in isos groups opinion the qsr report is a fair representation of the companys sustainabilityrelated strategies management systems and performance the report along with referenced materials in the k information posted on the company website and supplemental documentation supplied to isos meet the general content and quality requirements of the gri g framework we have evaluated the reports ability to address specific criteria within the following main tasks on a scale of good acceptable fair and needs improvement credibility check good qualcomm has accurately referenced the reported indicators in the gri content index it is also apparent that the companys organizational structure fully supports sustainability related activities just as the mission and vision have set the tone for the newly instituted organizational structure needed for a robust sustainability reporting process statements from the ceo validate the companys acknowledged risks opportunities and strategies for integrating sustainable development into the greater business ethos at all locations and communities served continuing to formalize this process particularly through structured stakeholder feedback mechanisms will further strengthen the materiality of issues reported by the company in the future closer consultation with the indicator protocols throughout the reporting cycle will also increase the companys ability to transition to an extended number of fully reported indicators quantitative review acceptable sample indicators we believe that all data included in the report is accurate and that the company will continue to improve its metrics for illustrating performance of material issues our opinion is based upon careful analysis and verification of supplemental documentation requested by isos although the company has made significant strides to improve comparisons from the previous year this task could be further strengthened by drawing a correlation to other comparative data points and leveraging internal stakeholders feedback for goals setting incremental steps made to provide better coverage in the area of product responsibility could generate greater awareness for the companys responsible product design efforts qualitative review good when considering the reporting boundary and material issues identified by qualcomm we do not believe that the report misrepresents significant economic environmental and social impacts or omits relevant information that would influence stakeholder decisions while the company should be commended for their efforts to apply gris content and quality principles effectively it is suggested that further improvements in the area of stakeholders engagement be continued the qsr report is an attestation in itself to the commitments the company has made to driving sustainability deeper into the organization and the benefits of instituting a firm process needed for producing a valuable management and communication tool sustainability action balance good the company has been found to be consistent with their management approach responsive to priority issues expressed by internal stakeholders and aware of their current sustainability context progress has been made from the previous year to expand the number of disclosures made across all dimensions of sustainability and to report in a much more complete manner a solid organizational structure has elevated the companys strategic objectives to include a wide range of sustainability issues further demonstrating the leadership role it has taken in the marketplace furthermore a refreshed code of business conduct has been vital in sending a strong message about the companys commitment to operating ethically at all levels of its business and laid the foundation for reporting on a wider range of issues isos groups responsibilities isos and qualcomm agreed to uphold confidentiality arrangements between the two entities regarding correspondence and data exchange isos refuses to issue any statements or publications that contradict with information made public by the company in order to maintain privacy of all persons practices and systems involved our responsibility is to independently express conclusions on the reliability of managements assertions of select subject matters as defined within the agreed scope of work and intended by qualcomm in meeting all voluntary sustainability reporting disclosures we are committed to expressing an opinion based on our work performed as to whether any issues have come to our attention causing us to believe that the material data has not been prepared in accordance with relevant criteria the procedures selected are based on isos groups professional judgment our responsibility in performing this assurance is to the management of qualcomm only and in accordance with the terms agreed to with the company statement of independence isos group declares its independence from qualcomm on any reporting activity except

lives are interconnectedsand that understanding and collaboration are the right way forward when waste management faces difficult times we respond and work to recover and become stronger than before as the coronavirus crisis began to unfold we reacted swiftly taking care of employees with strong safety protocols and financial assurance we took care of customers by continuing our waste and recycling collection services without interruption supplying an essential feedstock for markets that use recycled material to produce the products and packages that we rely on each day likewise in the aftermath of the death of george floyd in minneapolis waste managementtms inclusion and diversity staff activated a series of dialogues and programs to further inclusivity among all employees and to facilitate constructive discussions in our workplaces we will continue to establish new cultural norms and to ensure consistent practices around education and equity with goals established to guide this effort itmve always been proud of waste managementtms people first culture and thattms never been more true than in recent months amidst all of these crises we haventmt lost sight of our essential role in protecting the environment and contributing to a circular economy as of the fall of we are processing a growing volume of residential recyclables we continue to reduce our fleet emissions and we are creating value from waste at our landfills to generate clean renewable energy record investments in our recycling infrastructure and fleet will help us continue on this path as

employees care fund inc is a public nonprofit c organization that provides shortterm financial assistance to waste management employees during unexpected financial hardships and emergencies this fund is intended to assist employees in filling financial gaps that exist following unexpected emergencies the vast majority of the fund is supported directly by other waste management employees and is one example of how we support and take care of each other during times of need hurricanes for some natural disasters weather forecasts provide critical warning time to prepare major hurricanes in and most notably hurricane michael required dedicated efforts by a team of experts to protect employees safeguard trucks and facilities and bring in supplies after storms passed when michael devastated a large swath of the southern us in october waste management was one of the first responders delivering rolloff containers to essential businesses and utilities local hospitals grocery stores and shelters we deployed a green team of approximately employees who assisted with relief efforts including driving vehicles cleaning up debris and preparing meals beyond the internal cleanup and recovery process waste management prioritized communicating our operational status to our customers through every available medium wildfires compared with the tropical storms that affect the eastern and southern us the fires that occur with increasing frequency in the western us and canada require very different preparation and response our firerelated communication plans response and recovery efforts are increasingly tested in november of waste managementtms simi valley landfill worked with their employees and the deployed wm green team to handle debris from the woolsey fire which burned in californiatms los angeles and ventura counties we made upgrades at the facility to accommodate the increased volume including expanding our staff adding equipment and renting electronic signage and

waste management sustainability report sustainabilitywmcom contributing to communities waste management sustainability report sustainabilitywmcom the camp fire ignited in paradise california the same day as the woolsey fire while waste management does not provide service to the paradise community we have extensive operations throughout the surrounding area so many of our employees customers and business units in the region were affected because the containment of the fire was uncertain our procurement staff worked to ensure operating units in the affected areas had the necessary masks water and other critical supplies in the wake of the fire waste management employees were displaced from their homes we secured relief for them in the form of hotel rooms rental cars clothing allowances and meals as well as grants from the waste management employees care fund waste management even organized a catered thanksgiving dinner at a community center so that employees and their families could celebrate together despite the upheaval once the cleanup process began wm green team members from across the country assisted with hauling and post collection operations our landfill in anderson

t u pdate dear valued stakeholder it is my pleasure to update you on waste managementtms progress in achieving our sustainability goals for recycling renewable energy generation energy e ciency and land conservation it has been just over three years since we set these goals and we have come to realize that attaining them is part of a larger transformation of our business we do more than just manage waste increasingly we are managing the resources in waste in a way that extracts the best value this allows us to help our customers from businesses to municipalities to reinvent their waste streams and meet their sustainability goals as we meet our customerstm goals we also pursue our own and challenge ourselves to expand the way we think about sustainability here are some highlights as north americatms largest recycler of municipal solid waste we have been through some tough economic times over the past couple years in recycling markets bounced back and the amount of recyclables we managed increased with million tons of materials currently recycled we are now more than halfway to our goal of managing more than million tons each year we recycled enough material in to ll a football eld miles high one innovative means we are using to boost recycling rates is through our subsidiary greenopolis greenopolis collaborates with other companies like pepsico to increase recycling our digital kiosks allow consumers to recycle fion the gofl at gas stations grocery stores stadiums and other venues where recycling o en isntmt convenient we are changing that we are also expanding the scope of our recycling capabilities working with partners to tackle the challenge of converting materials that are hard to recycle into valuable products waste is an important source of renewable energy and the conversion of waste to power is a key focus for us currently we produce more renewable energy than the entire solar industry in the united states powering the equivalent of million homes our goal is to power more than million homes by our land llgastoenergy plants convert a potent greenhouse gas methane into a source of renew able power in early as part of a consortium with cory environmental our wholly owned subsidiary wheelabrator was selected to build a stateoftheart power and recycling center in the united kingdom through its partnership with shanghai chengtou holding wheelabrator is also making progress on seven wastetoenergy projects in china two are now operational and ve are under construction with two of the latter set to be operational in we also continue our work to lower the emissions and increase the e ciency of our eet of trucks and other vehicles our eet currently includes nearly vehicles fueled by lique ed natural gas lng and compressed natural gas cng and we continue to convert trucks to these clean fuels each year in a joint venture with linde north america we have built the worldtms largest plant to convert land ll gas to ultralowcarbon lng the greenhouse gas emissions associated with this fuel are to percent lower than those of diesel and particulate emissions are percent lower our facility produces gallons of lng per day and helps to power our eet of natural gas trucks in california our investment in terrabon o ers additional opportunities to convert organics into figreen gasolinefl terrabontms mixalco is an acid fermentation process that can convert nonfood biomass into highoctane lowsulfur transportation fuel in we set a goal to quadruple the number of habitats at waste management facilities certi ed by the wildlife habitat council i am proud that our team achieved that goal years early we now have sites with certi cations and we have protected about acres and we are going to keep going with concerted e orts to renew existing project certi cations and expand to more sites in the future we do more than just manage waste increasingly we are managing the resources in waste in a way that extracts the best value was t e manage m en t s us t ainabili t y r epor t u pda t e in this letter i am able for the rst time to talk to you about yeartoyear progress with our entitywide carbon footprint we measured our footprint for the rst time in and reported it in our sustainability report this was an exacting and complex e ort and an important milestone for us when we updated our footprint in our carbon emissions had increased a major factor was the increased collection and processing of recyclables another less signi cant factor was that we continued to re ne our reporting protocols train our employ ees and improve the accuracy of our systems to put this in context however our emissions intensity measured by metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents co e per unit of total revenue remained constant from to in we focused our companytms investment strategy on broadening the scope of materials we can recover from waste streams and transform into resources today we have a portfolio of nearly acquisitions joint ventures and investment projects at various stages of development for example we invested in harvest power which plans to build finextgenerationfl organic waste management facilities these facilities will create clean biogas and nutrientrich compost through anaerobic digestion ie biogas to power we also entered into a joint development agreement with genomatica to create proprietary specially designed organisms and manufacturing processes to create highvalue chemical products from waste i am proud of the men and women of waste management who have taken our sustainability goals to heart and i have no doubt that we will achieve them by to the bene t of our communities our governments our customers our employees and the environment respectfully d avid p s

can create less waste in the rst place we have maintained recycling at percent of revenue while managing million tons of material ittms important to note that although national recycling rates are slightly down we were able to counterbalance this trend by o ering our services to the utility industry converting coal ash into a feedstock for cement and other encapsulated uses this bene cial use of residual material resulting from coal combustion was classi ed as firecyclingfl by us epa in december and we have adopted their de nition in our classi cations this is an important line of business for waste management and a form of recycling that has been embraced by us epa our customers and the environmental community alike because it is safe protective of the environment and conserves natural resources we have been encouraged by a percent increase in revenues attributable to our innovative service lines such as our sustainability consulting business new ventures like land llgastofuel

funneling discarded materials back into the manufacturing process is a nobrainer instead of mining new resources this ficircular economyfl mindset urges us to use and reuse materials time and again recycling them and reusing them in a closed loop of innovation avoiding the mining and extraction of new materials reduces demands on natural resources and reduces the carbon and other emissions that result from the manufacturing process the concept works particularly well for metals which are almost inde nitely reusable for products like paper and metal resource reuse is also generally cheaper than use of virgin materials reducing waste waste management works with public and private sector customers to reduce the waste they generate extracting value from organics waste management is working on creative ways to mitigate the challenges in transporting food waste and other organics and the economics of expensive organics processing growing recycling waste management has embarked with customers on a campaign to make sure con sumers remember to recycle wherever they are and to en sure they treat recyclables as valuable commodities s that they firecycle rightfl recovering energy from waste waste management is focusing on the natural strengths and e ciencies we can bring to convert waste that isntmt recycled into energy we continue to supply feedstock to waste toenergy facilities

awareness of the urgent need to get serious about recycling s its economics and its wellestablished environmental value this year ittms no di erent waste management is north americatms largest residential recycler and as such we strongly believe we need to lead change to put recycling on its strongest possible foot for the future as noted in this report and talked about broadly in the media with our customers and numerous other stakeholders recycling must evolve wetmve started to see progress on this front and steady progress is what we need s for the good times and the bad change starts with rst acknowledging some very real challenges facing the recycling industry including a changing waste stream slowing global demand low commodity prices and rising processing costs all of which collided to place the entire recycling industry on its heels let me elaborate just a bit a changing waste environment as a society our waste stream is changing wetmre seeing more s and more complex s plastics and less paper complex sorting systems designed for a largely paperdriven input are not perfectly suited to process what is today a very di erent waste stream signi cant shi s in the global market in recycled commodities have also had to be reckoned with as foreign economies slowed so slowed the demand for us commodities and the price of commodities plunged s dramatically and for a sustained period the value of plastic for example parallels that of oil s and that value nosedived in to add to all that we were seeing more and more nonrecyclable materials coming through our recycling processing facilities causing processing costs to rise in we tightened our belts on our recycling operations increasing our e ciencies and lowering operating costs all of which translated into corresponding bene ts to our nancial performance our teams did a magni cent job in this regard we also collaborated with our municipal and business customers to nd muchneeded e ciencies in the system and wetmre pleased to report that for the most part we have found willing partners collectively we embraced the notion of firecycling rightfl as a critical message and took steps to ensure that message translated into meaningful action reducing contamination s loose plastic bags and other fitanglersfl that wrap around the recycling equipment bagged trash in the recyclables and food and liquid waste s reduces processing costs and raises the value of the clean recyclables that can be sold our customers appreciate the transparency in our approach to recycling service contracts as we clarify both the costs of processing and likely returns from commodity sales our work with many partners on recycling education has brought contamination down signi cantly for many cities including

reporting annually on our sustainability performance including both our achievements and opportunities for improvement report content s this year to sharpen our reporting focus and to help guide future strategy we undertook a sustainability materiality analysis this analysis allowed us to take a close and considered look at the issues that are of the highest concern to our stakeholders and that could signi cantly affect our ability to execute our business strategy in effect the materiality analysis highlights areas both of opportunity and risk to help us re ne our overall strategic reporting approach and improve performance working with business for social responsibility bsr a leading corporate responsibility consultancy and research rm we began our analysis by evaluating stakeholder concerns we reviewed stakeholder input gathered directly through interviews with agency owners investors suppliers customers policymakers and ngos as well as through indirect materials such as ranking surveys trade reports and other materials these interviews helped us to better understand stakeholder priorities and concerns related to a range of issues we also conducted internal surveys and discussions interviewing business leaders of key functions including human resources enterprise and risk management sourcing and procurement corporate relations and law and regulation in order to clearly identify how environmental and social issues were increasingly interconnected with business objectives this information was then brought together in a leadership workshop to re ne the resulting matrix and discuss implications for our sustainability reporting and for our strategy as a result of this materiality analysis we increased reporting in some areas and added a few entirely new sections for example we increased our reporting on our efforts related to natural catastrophe preparedness since this issue has a signi cant impact on our business and is clearly a priority for our customers and the communities we serve our sustainability materiality analysis indicated data privacy is an issue of rising importance and as a result we have expanded our reporting on how we protect data privacy and our customerstm key concerns new report content on corporate involvement in public policy discloses information on allstate board oversight and contribution to governance

their sense of volunteerism without them none of this would be possible whether it is by responding to major international tragedies such as the tsunami or by helping out at the local homeless shelter our employeestm actions are a source of pride for oracle with continued hard work we intend to maintain our reputation as an innovative leader in our industry as we continue our commitment to good corporate citizenship i welcome your feedback to this report at commitmentwworaclecom safra a catz president oracle qa oracle president safra catz q why is oracle producing this report now a oracle has a long history of doing good work in the communities it serves around the world but we haventmt talked about it very much while this report is not a comprehensive listing of our contributions to the community we hope the efforts wetmve highlighted will provide a sense of what we do and encourage even more people to get involved q how does this report intersect with what is known as corporate social responsibility a there has been a growing interest in corporate responsibility and citizenship issues in recent years generally referred to as corporate social responsibility csr however csr has traditionally focused on issuesssuch as downstream labor conditions in the supply chain or waste disposal from heavy manufacturers sthat the enterprise software and services industry doesntmt really face yet oracle does face a number of challengesssuch as workforce preparation security privacysand must consider the needs of our customers employees and host communities what you will nd here is a report that re ects the issues of the enterprise software industry as opposed to initiatives you might nd in a report from a consumer brand or a manufacturing enterprise customers employees partners shareholders and community representatives are increasingly asking for this type of information we already have the programs in placesso wetmre now making the information more accessible q is a companytms approach to corporate citizenship at odds with its nancial success a absolutely not being a responsible corporate citizen does not mean losing focus on the interests of our shareholders it means nding intersections between the needs of our communities and the goals of our company and making investments that bene t both it also means using our technology to advance interests in the community for example oracletms academic initiative has provided technical training in countries around the worldsa us billion investment in the future prospects of more than students this program not only lays the groundwork for many successful careers but it helps us expand the pool of talent available to support oracle solutions for our customers ittms a great example of how good social

advantage of new fiimperfectly deliciousfl vegetable options provided by their supplier this product option makes vegetables that dontmt meet the aesthetic standards of grocery stores available to commercial kitchens for purchase at a discounted rate approximately pounds of imperfectlooking and perfectly safe and healthy squash and ngerling potatoes were processed by savor for the event caterers are improving supply chain transparency as oracle has requested deeper information about food served distributor and producer information for standard suppliers representing less than of food volume was provided three months in advance by savor in addition postevent reports disclose sourcing information for of food volume information is still lacking for outsourced food including boxed lunches served by hotel venues so while transparency is improving more work needs to be done and ideally could occur earlier in the planning process with better food knowledge comes clear options to make better choices that reduce waste and carbon and support healthy communities oracle took major strides this year in this area see next page paying particular attention to waste reduction opportunities future opportunities include increasing use of certi ed organic food and veri ed fair labor produce both of which are low or unknown at this time until recently oracle has not known enough about suppliers early enough to share information about food choices with participants it has also been di cult to predict fiimperfectly deliciousfl food that will be available during the event this is improving and tools like the mobile app present opportunities to begin to share information better the timing is also good to create unique food experiences that highlight food sustainability issues such as food waste to attendees in very visible ways that hopefully lead to better choices in their daily life supply chain transparency who are we buying from shift to better food choices can we design food service to meet our goals communicate can we inform and involve attendees in making good food choices spotlight four goals one focus careful attention to food service will allow oracle

key global compliance policies and expectations now all of our global team members are expected to follow the same rules for privacy anticorruption trade compliance competition law and conflicts of

largest forest products companies we employ thousands of people in businesses that grow harvest and sell trees and make a range of forest products essential to everyday lives what we do our value chain is simple we start by planting trees lots of them we manage our forests sustainably over many decades and help others manage their lands equally well once harvested our trees and other wood fiber are made into useful products for society and we sell our trees to other manufacturing companies that do the same we are proud managers of a remarkable renewable resource that when managed well can provide jobs products recreation and environmental benefits for many generations to come we plant and care for trees in we planted million seedlings most of which were grown in our own nurseries we use qualified treeplanting crews to ensure our seedlings are planted correctly and given the best possible chance for survival we sustainably grow and manage forests we manage million acres of timberlands in the united states canada and uruguay some of which we own and some of which we manage under longterm government licenses read more about our approach to sustainable forestry the wood we grow on our own timberlands is sold directly to our wood products and cellulose fiber mills or to customers all over the world read about where our logs go in our annual report we hire qualified logging professionals when harvesting our timberlands and require other forest landowners from whom we buy wood to do the same we responsibly source materials by far the largest and most critical link in our supply chain is raw wood fiber in the form of logs and chips which we convert into wood products and cellulose fibers we supply our own wood fiber as well as procure wood fiber from other sources our wood procurement policy ensures we and our sources do not cause or encourage destruction of forest areas at risk of loss from unsustainable practices or illegal logging we conduct due diligence and document the species and country of origin of our products on our product environmental profiles our commitment to responsible fiber sourcing is verified through our certification to the sustainable forestry initiative standard read more about how we promote sustainable forest management with all of our wood suppliers and more about our certification programs at our manufacturing facilities we produce most of our own energy with biomass residuals but we still purchase some fuel and electricity to supplement our energy needs we also rely heavily on transportation and logistics providers to move our raw material and our finished products from our forests to our mills to our customers we create useful products we are proud that our company makes useful products for society our lumber and engineered wood products are used to construct commercial buildings and homes where people raise their families our cellulose fibers are used in diapers and other hygiene products that

innovation and marketing in ways that help billions of people and their pets lead healthier happier livesfood safety security challenging gamers to solve food toxin puzzles we launched a global gaming challenge through foldit an online puzzlesolving platform that allows anyone with a computer and an imagination to crack complex scientific problems the first challenge is to find ways to wipe out aflatoxina poison produced by certain molds that can contaminate staple foods causing liver cancer and stunted growth this toxin contaminates a quarter of crops like maize and rice in the field at harvest and in storagecontributing to food waste as well as health risks enzymes that can degrade the toxin might offer an effective solution for material in storageworking with partners including the university of california davis thermo fisher scientific university of washington northeastern university and the partnership for aflatoxin control in africa were asking players to solve d puzzles that mimic the structure of aflatoxin proteins we hope their answers might produce quick solutions that would otherwise take experts years to discover hundreds of gamers from around the world have produced more than million designs that are currently being testedfood security and food safety are intrinsically linked if food isnt safe it isnt food for food to provide nutrition and nourish wellbeing it must be safe approximately one in every ten people on the planet suffers from eating unsafe foods so our goal is to help combat food insecurity by addressing food safety challenges around the world no one entity can tackle these challenges alonethats why in we created the mars global food safety center a precompetitive facility focused on research training and collaboration and dedicated to helping

produce oil and natural gas operate in a market undergoing continual change while serving stakeholders whose expectations are also evolving our strategies must adapt to changing times and address multiple challenges for example in recent years we have taken a broad range of actions to withstand weak oil and natural gas prices by streamlining operations and improving e ciency these actions have reduced our cost of supply s all the capital overhead and operating expenses that it costs to produce oil and natural gas and wetmve seen many of these actions also enhance our performance as a safe and responsible employer community member and environmental steward we are developing innovative ways to recycle and reuse water reduce our own energy and materials use in the production process shrink the land foot print used for drilling sites and decrease resulting emissions these and other measures contributed to a projected percent reduction in our annual adjusted operating costs in as compared to while lessening our environmental impact we are also pleased to report that was our best overall year yet in safety performance we believe this improvement in performance stems from our focus on formally adopting life saving rules and followup programs to verify and reinforce them in the eld this achievement is a credit to our people who are working safely while exceeding operational targets additionally we further reduced our greenhouse gas emissions and updated our marginal abatement cost curve used to assess possible future reductions since wetmve reduced almost million tonnes

requests for our participation in addressing matters ranging from local community concerns to broad global issues as well as greater transparency about our performance these engagements reinforce our longstanding commitment to demonstrating leadership in the way we produce natural gas and oil resources by being competitive both financially and with our environmental and social performance determining how to effectively manage climate change while maintaining human and economic progress is among modern societys most compelling challenges we believe there are many possible pathways to a lowcarbon energy transition and while natural gas and oil will continue to be part of the energy mix how they are produced will remain critical though we cannot predict with certainty what the transition will look like we are working to ensure we have a business strategy in place that provides ongoing resilience in a challenging marketplace our managing climaterelated risks report

progress we made in against goals set in our report establish new goals for and foster continued discussion and engagement with all of our stakeholders on the complex issues surrounding sustainabilityall information provided in this report including financial data is for our fiscal year ended november unless otherwise noted we also identify in this report a number of goals and priorities for we fully intend to do our best to achieve these objectives subject to shifts in the business climate we have made reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of the information in this report certain data estimations calculations and comparisons presented herein are provided by or are based on third party sources including public agencies and methods that we believe to be reliable but that we have not independently evaluated or confirmed in addition some of these data estimations calculations and comparisons while growing in use and acceptance are relatively new and may be subject to revisions refinements and updates or superseded over time by other data measures or metricsas with our previous reports this report follows the global reporting initiative gri guidelines which provide a widely recognized level of accountability and transparency and are considered by many environmental experts to be the current international standard for sustainability reporting a full accounting of the gri indicators addressed in this report and more information on gri guidelines can be found in the gri index of indicators section we are committed to issuing additional reports in the future reflecting the integral role of sustainability in kb homes business to our customers employees stockholders and partners in sustainabilityi am pleased to share with you kb homes fifth annual sustainability report we have accomplished quite a lot in five relatively short years toward our goal of becoming a leading environmentally friendly company while recognizing that kb home and the overall homebuilding industry still have considerable areas of opportunity was another year of great progress for our company as we took many actions on behalf of both our customers and the environment in the area of sustainability throughout the year in addition to building all of our new homes throughout the year to energy star guidelines we broke new ground in our industry with the companywide launch of the kb home energy performance guide or epg in february similar to an mpg sticker for new cars the epg shows consumers what we expect their energy bills to be in an energyefficient kb home as designed as well as the estimated monthly savings that are possible with such a kb home we also decided to offer and showcase more homes with solar power systems in an effort to encourage more americans to power their homes with this clean and renewable resource in march we made solar power systems a standard feature of homes in of our communities in southern california and have since expanded this initiative to additional communities in september we introduced our new zerohouse option an exciting program designed to give our homebuyers the choice to make almost any kb home a netzero energy home that can produce as much energy as it consumes these offerings provide benefits to the environment as well as our homebuyers and kb home is in the unique position to evaluate the resonance of these options with todays consumer the expense of these options relative to the potential savings is a key concern for many of our customers and we can leverage our economies of scale as we determine the optimal offerings for our homebuyerswhat will never change however and one thing that i will never question is our focus on our customers our customers are one of the primary reasons why every home we build today is in several ways more sustainable than a typical existing home the energy and watersaving features and building technologies incorporated into every kb home give all of our buyers the opportunity to lower their monthly utility costs and enjoy considerable savings for years to come while also lessening their negative impact on the environment we continue to believe that our commitment to sustainability is simply the right thing to do for our customers our employees our stockholders our company and the environment and so in we intend to keep moving forward working toward achieving new goals through our companywide my home my earth program our goals are centered around the categories of consumer benefits and awareness energy efficiency and building science innovation water efficiency and conservation and waste reductioni am very proud of our employees who are working hard every day to meet the goals we have set for ourselves and take great pride in knowing that the homes we build are not only making an important difference in the lives of those who own them but can also be helpful to the environment we consider

pleased to mark this earth day with the publication of kb hometms ninth annual sustainability report this report is a compendium of our work in to advance our commitment to sustainable homebuilding since building our rst energy star certi ed home in kb home has become recognized as a leader in sustainability in the homebuilding industry at that time the conventional wisdom was that environmentally minded homes were a niche product for homebuyers in the fully custom and luxury home segments sustainable homes were seen as something that many families would be unwilling or unable to purchase despite this viewpoint we saw an opportunity to apply the processdriven approach and personalization tools of our kb business model to build affordable sustainable homes by integrating sustainability into our homebuilding operations we have been able to identify and execute costeffective highimpact product changes and production methods this allows mainstream homebuyers across the country the ability to own a beautiful and highly energyef cient home at a reasonable price point what underlies our approach is the combination of practicality and innovation that has always been part of our business evolution and revolution these are the watchwords that motivate us every day we continuously evolve our sustainable building practices with improvements in building processes and products that move the needle on energy and water conservation in every home we build at minimal cost to the homebuyer we also utilize our kb home design studio to gauge homebuyer interest in various sustainable products and technologies and adjust our offerings accordingly this daily discipline of incremental change is punctuated by moments of revolution that propel us ahead of the industry through our researchdriven model for identifying testing re ning and implementing new technologies it is a balanced approach that is grounded in maintaining affordability while increasing environmental performance in the production home market since launching our sustainability initiative nearly a decade ago our pragmatic program and operational exibility have enabled us to drive this change across the thousands of homes we build each year and create a critical mass of realworld measurable and meaningful savings for the bene t of our customers and the environment our forwardlooking pilot programs of new technologies help position us for the future with highly ef cient products and design that offer the potential for signi cant savings and increased comfort thoughtful evaluation of technologies materials and methods in realworld environments can drive down costs over time while also allowing us to gain insight into consumer attitudes and preferences in some cases we nd that a promising technology or method isntmt quite ready for broad implementation other times we are able to utilize learnings from these pilots to make improvements and systematically roll out new features or processes across the company for example since building our rst zerohouse in we have been able to reduce the incremental costs of building netzero energy homes by and reduce the additional building cycle time by as a result we are looking at being able to build our rst neighborhood made up entirely of netzero energy homes in the near future while still ensuring that our homes remain affordable

monthly budgets it is a key competitive advantage for us against other typical new homes as well as our biggest competition resale homes we feature our proprietary epg energy performance guide for every home design we offer company wide clearly showing how our homestm energy ef ciency measures up against both typical new and resale homes as well as estimated utility costs that are updated annually to re ect utility rate changes in addition after construction is complete the energy performance of every one of our homes is independently veri ed by a thirdparty energy rater this exceeds the testing required by the energy star programtms guidelines dedication delivers meaningful results as a major national builder delivering thousands of homes a year we have the ability to make a meaningful difference when we take on a companywide commitment to increased energy ef ciency in we made an industry rst commitment to build of our homes to the energy star standard and we remain only one of three national builders to do so as epa has evolved energy star by adding more rigor and continually raising the bar with each new release we have continued to meet the challenge of providing our homebuyers with this increasing level of energy ef ciency in addition we verify the asbuilt energy performance of our homes by testing every energy star home we build at the end of construction beyond the minimum sampling that epa requires we are the clear industry leader building more energy star certi ed new homes in recent years including than any other homebuilder our consistent

what they can save in money and energy homebuyers today want to be able to operate their homes from wherever they are and not just have them respond to their needs but actually anticipate them while also saving energy water and money we believe the future of sustainability will be largely driven by innovations in technology that create a seamless ow between greater convenience and greater ef

longterm energy usage was of greatest importance to these core stakeholders as a result we have made increasing the energy efficiency of our homes our primary sustainability focus in addition as a

competitive advantage from the outset energy ef ciency has been the cornerstone of our sustainability focus for one simple reason it is what our homebuyers care about most energy ef ciency transforms sustainability into a tangible bene t for their monthly budgets it is a key competitive advantage for us against other typical new homes as well as our biggest competition resale homes we feature our proprietary epg energy performance guide for every home design we offer company wide clearly showing how our homestm energy ef ciency measures up against both typical new and resale homes as well as estimated utility costs that are updated annually to re ect utility rate changes in addition after construction is complete the energy performance of every one of our homes is independently veri ed by a thirdparty energy rater this exceeds the testing required by the energy star programtms guidelines dedication delivers meaningful results as a major national builder delivering thousands of homes a

simple reason it is what our homebuyers care about most energy ef ciency transforms sustainability into a tangible bene t for their monthly budgets it is a key competitive advantage for us against other typical new homes as well as our biggest competition resale homes we feature our proprietary epg energy performance guide for every home design we offer company wide clearly showing how our homestm energy ef ciency measures up against both typical new and resale homes as well as estimated utility costs that are updated annually to re ect utility rate changes in addition after

guidelines dedication delivers meaningful results as a major national builder delivering thousands of homes a year we have the ability to make a meaningful difference when we take on a companywide commitment to increased energy ef ciency in we made an industry rst commitment to build of our homes to the energy star standard and we remain only one of three national builders to do so as epa has evolved energy star by adding more rigor and continually raising the bar with each new release we have continued to meet the challenge of providing our homebuyers with this increasing level of energy

those areas are vendor social compliance attention to governance leveraging our culture united with our communities environmental sustainability table of contents the tjx companies inc about our company letter from our chairman and chief executive officer environmental sustainability the tjx companies inc as a result of this program wetmve seen more productive use of the storestm limited backroom space freeing up more space to process merchandise and a more thoughtful approach for reusing and recycling materials based on our success in the us in our european business adapted our model to prioritize the removal of excess xtures from stores to ensure that each of our uk stores have just the right amount of xtures needed to operate effectively stores were directed to send excess equipment back to the new uk arrc and to make a list of equipment they anticipated they would need in the near future arrc project managers reviewed the inventory sorted items and marked them for resale recycling or redeployment elsewhere in our store network all stores in the uk participated in this effort and as result thousands of pallets of equipment were sent to a central arrc warehouse to be sorted refurbished or redeployed results to date have been very positive with signi cant savings in as new equipment did not need to be purchased equally important backroom storage space has increased allowing more merchandise to be transported with each truckload resulting in fewer deliveries and a reduction in distribution costs tjx europe is currently testing this approach in germany and poland spotlight environmental sustainability the tjx companies inc as we continue on our path to becoming a billionplus global value retailer we keep sustainability top of mind by examining where we might improve operational ef ciency and reduce environmental impact was an exciting year as we initiated construction and designed the interior space of our new canadian corporate headquarters we

design and will support our organizationtms needs as we continue to grow tjx canada new corporate headquarters tjx rst entered canada years ago with the acquisition of winners stores now tjx canada operates winners homesense and marshalls stores combined and in the past years alone wetmve grown our store base over having outgrown our current of ce space we developed a plan to add home of ce infrastructure by constructing a larger canadian corporate headquarters building during planning discussions for our new building we made a conscious decision to integrate environmentally sound building design elements into the project at the outset of the project we made the decision to work towards leed guidelines to help us build and operate a figreenerfl canadian headquarters leed stands for leadership in energy and environmental design and is a green building certi cation program that recognizes bestinclass building strategies and practices during construction we installed energy ef cient lighting and hvac systems and ensured that all appliances and equipment were energy ef cient building figreenerfl by design spotlight environmental sustainability the tjx companies inc the building includes several features new to tjx home of ces like electric car charging stations a bicycle storage room and a butter y garden our cafeteria features beautiful tables and chairs made from local urban trees that would have otherwise become mulch as we prepared to exit our former canadian corporate headquarters we carefully considered opportunities to reduce our impact on the environment we engaged with a notforpro t organization to see that all unwanted of ce furniture or equipment is donated to charitable organizations or recycled appropriately and not sent to land ll now that wetmve moved into our new canadian headquarters our associates are contributing to our ongoing green efforts through their participation in recycling and composting today we have tri sorter waste bins in common areas for organic material recycling and land ll waste versus individual of ce trash receptacles the interior of the building is bright and open with an abundance of plants to enhance the workspace our new canadian headquarters also offers a smart commute program which allows associates to easily nd others in their neighborhood via an online app and arrange a carpool to and from work new homegoods distribution center our new homegoods distribution center in jefferson georgia is also a good example of our environmental sustainability efforts homegoods operates over stores in the us

of exciting home fashions to our stores from conveniently located distribution centers across the us with this new facility we have built in the capacity necessary to meet our growth goals for the southeast region of the us for many years the square foot facility is dynamic and provides us with maximum operational exibility the building design elements include an open concept oor plan so that

practicesin bed bath beyond established and published a best practice document for reducing copy paper consumption some of the practices that were implemented includeelimination of fax confirmation pages a commitment to duplex printing and an annual review of regularly generated documentsthese published practices not only impact the amount of paper used but the amount of toner as well some other practices include limiting the use of shading use of print preview tobetter format documents and electronic review and filing of documents since all printers purchased for our corporate office and warehouse locations have duplex capabilityand are defaulted to duplex printing as of all printers purchased for the stores throughout the company are also duplex capable and default to duplex

annually technology innovation can dramatically improve the productivity in this system and bring vast immediate improvements in quality of life like helping underserved communities access bigcity

placed under the responsibility of mr eric duvaud partner in charge of our climate change and sustainability service limitations of our review our review was limited to the statements and indicators all bulleted items identifi ed above and did not cover other disclosures in the cr report a higher level of assurance would have required more extensive work information about the reporting criteria and the statements preparation process with regards to the reporting criteria and the statements preparation policies and principles we wish to make the following comments relevance alcatellucents sustainability reporting is made up of a wide set of indicators allowing coverage of the sectors key cr issues concerning energy and impact on climate change alcatellucent has improved the calculation of its corporate carbon footprint in particular by using extrapolation methods which defi ne for each site production site offi ces the average consumption depending on surface area and on the basis of a previous study on group sites energy consumption the indicator related to products energy efficiency targeted an objective for year it should be replaced next year by an indicator taking into account updated improvement objectives completeness the indicators reporting perimeter aims to cover all of alcatellucents relevant activities however the total group perimeter is not covered this year for some indicators for environmental indicators the reporting process is implemented th roughout the companys signifi cant entities for the nonreporting an extrapolation of data is performed in order to cover of the companys environmental impacts sites a description of the extrapolation method is provided on page the reporting coverage of each environmental indicator is presented as follows for the carbon footprint indicator alcatellucent decided to extend the scope of the reporting by including some of the scope greenhouse gases emissions however the greenhouse gases emissions relating to the following items are not yet included entering materials contracted road transportation of goods waste life ending fixed assets reliability alcatel lucents reporting process is supported by dedicated computer based reporting tools these tools together with a quite structured internal control process performed at site level by the validator and then at consolidation level by environmental and health and safety experts allow for the company to improve data reliability nevertheless internal controls at the site level should be better formalized and more systematically performed in particular controls expected by the validator should be described in the reporting guidelines and could be integrated directly in the computerbased tools the reporting of the social and societal indicators is not yet documented through corporate guidelines defi ning indicators as well as calculation methodologies neutrality and clarity a pedagogical effort is made to reporting contributors through the format of the reporting guidelines however some defi nitions should be clarifi ed and more examples provided in the cr protocol in order to make results more robust and replicable in the future conclusion based on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the indicators were not established in all material aspects in accordance with the reporting

messagei am very proud that alcatellucent earned the rank of sector leader in the dow jones sustainability index it was an objective measurement of our progress in ensuring we act and behave as a balanced contributing global companywe also have a huge role to play in extending the bene ts of advanced communications technology to underserved communities and doing it using green innovation and nally green is a necessity for the industry as well as a response to climate change and a driver of economic growth todays video revolution requires a complete shift in the way telecom companies think about their solutions therefore we will increase our ambitions in green innovation to be the absolute industry leader in innovative ecosustainable communications technologies so as you read through this report know that i am very excited about the progress we made in but am even more excited about what we will accomplish with you in ben verwaayenand fp launch are just two examples of the innovation we are bringing to the marketplace and cocreating with our customers and partners we are taking steps to make all of our operations greener from the solar eld that now provides some of the power for our bell labs headquarters in new jersey to more telecommuting options for our employees all of our employees reviewed and acknowledged our code of conduct and know that we have a zero tolerance policy regarding any violations of our ethics and compliance standards tens of thousands of my alcatellucent colleagues also took part in volunteer programs supported by the alcatellucent foundation and i know that number and the impact will grow in but now we need to do more maintenance is not enough we want to strengthen our commitment to sustainability and invite others to partner with us and contribute to our commitments in our challenge will be to embed corporate responsibility and sustainability across the dna of our organization we will put more focus on diversity particularly in the area of gender equality as well as develop more of an understanding of cultural differences this will be an important element in our ability to attract and retain the kind of talent needed by a global hightech company like ourswith these global changes the expectation that companies such as alcatellucent accept the responsibility of being committed corporate citizens is the norm rather than the exceptionit makes no sense to think that when times are good and pro ts are easy then we can afford corporate responsibility activities corporate responsibility and sustainability has to be part of our business strategy in good times bad times and mediocre times day in and day out customers consumers and enterprises want to work with companies that treat employees with respect they want to deal with a company that invests in talent and diversity operates with integrity innovates in green and is engaged with the communities in which they operate investors look for companies that produce good nancial results but more and more they also want to know how they get those results iam very proud that alcatellucent earned the rank of sector leader in

collecting reporting and analyzing cr metrics and information this tool together with a fairly structured internal process helps monitor the evolution of environmental health and safety performance at site level and increases the reliability of alcatellucents cr datareporting processes are formalized into written protocols for most indicators however the protocols should give more detailed guidance on internal controls as well as extrapolation methodologies to be performedall sources of information calculations and internal controls performed should be more systematically documented and properly stored in order to increase the traceability and reliability of the data neutrality and claritya pedagogical effort is made in order to ensure a harmonized understanding of the indicators and their definitions and calculations thanks to the written protocols however definitions should be clarified and more examples provided in order to ensure robust and replicable results in the future this applies more particularly to the number of days of absence due to workrelated accidentsconclusionbased on our review nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that nthe indicators

its research indicated that communications networks could be thousands of times more energy ef cient than they are today we could not sit on that knowledge and do nothing while we alone cannot develop all the technology and implement all the changes that will be needed in the decades ahead we could get the ball rolling so that is what we did we are committed to evolving our industry to be

implementation of energy ef ciency projects as well as the deployment of employee energy ef ciency awareness programs we have achieved an actual reduction of total co emissions of over from levels this consists of a reduction of of electricity usage and of fossil fuel usage rate from their values in we conducted a worldwide assessment of total co emissions associated with facility operations as

dumping of electronic wastes is gradually shifting from china to other developing nations such as india and countries in south america electronic wastes lucrative recyclable value enhances recyclers interests however price differences among different heavy metal wastes have left many valueless electronic wastes lying around to cause severe soil and water pollutions the improper handling has severely damaged our environment the absence of handling facilities and expertise also endangers the health of laborers working in such highlypolluted workplaces as many advanced countries move to establish regulations and processing for it product wastes acer maintains that such systems are more and urgently needed in developing countries to minimize improper processing of electronics waste we launched the acer ewaste programme in india to recycle any acer products on a free and voluntary basis recycling is done by registering on the internet or via email and the used items are mailed back to acer india for followup handling items included in the programme are desktops notebooks monitors projectors and servers the initiative is acers first step in voluntary and free product recycling in

signature seal on all tuppertms products tupperware products made their debut in however despite the durability and quality of earl tuppertms invention the product was not necessarily flying off the

governance action with accountability governance compliance and ethics supporting our associates safe working practices a focus on the future nurturing a better future example reorganizing for remote working in the philippines in the philippines with employee safety and also flexible efficient working opportunities in mind we have implemented a hybrid work arrangement at our philippines head office offering associates options to work at home or the office as the nature of the work permits in a survey associates stated their working preferences and the new arrangements take these into account in the following features flexible office space that allows associates to choose where to work with offices primarily for work that requires inperson collaboration in coworking spaces that are booked as needed smaller offices accommodating associates at a given time less than half of our total team this delivers cost benefits for the organization on leasing maintenance and parking flexible working hours with agreement in associate teams on core hours when inperson or virtual meetings can be scheduled the feedback from associates working remotely was that virtual meetings take up many hours in a day leaving insufficient time to do focused work free of distractions transition to laptop computers for all associates and a monthly cash allowance towards the costs of home working as well as improved tools and platforms for virtual meetings and communications embedded performance conversations in monthly coaching sessions holding associates accountable for delivering objectives through more regular checkins with their supervisors instead of formal performance reviews three times per year learning sessions on mindfulness managing motivation while working from home and leading remotely to help associates invest in their mental health and wellbeing especially during the covid pandemic to date the response has been overwhelmingly positive demonstrating that even in times of crisis we can work together to create better solutions health and safety for associates during covid pandemic all our manufacturing locations maintained their operations throughout the pandemic in

know this is critical to our employees customers suppliers stockholders and the communities where we live and work while the ght against the covid pandemic is far from over people companies and governments are recognizing important truths these truths go to the core of what it means for a business an economy and a society to be sustainable first manufacturing is critical to a countrytms ability to provide for its national economic and health security no industry is more foundational to manufacturing than steel steel is fundamental to necessary items such as cans for food and cleaning supplies and sheet products for hospital bed frames as well as automobiles refrigerators and buildings second regional supply chains are critical to sustainable production and delivery of many products required for a countrytms national economic and health security regional supply chains also reduce logistics costs and limit greenhouse gas emissions ghg by shortening transport distances for more than a century u s steel has delivered the steel that has sustained lives and livelihoods we have sustained our business for nearly years through wars pandemics and economic expansion and collapse u s steel will be there to sustainably produce the next generation of steel for the next generation of people this report documents our sustainability journey since our last sustainability

previous sustainability report u s steel has made a commitment to achieve a signi cant reduction in our global ghg emissions our commitment is challenging as we have committed to a reduction in our global ghg emissions intensity by based on baseline levels critical to achieving this goal is our best of bothtmtm strategy it combines the capability advantages of integrated mills which currently dominate our footprint with the exibility and cost bene ts of mini mills mini mill producers primarily manufacture steel from recycled scrap using electric arc furnace eaf technology while eaf technology is not new to u s steel as we have utilized eafs in our operations at times during our long history use of eaf technology in a mini mill con guration will be new to u s steel this move to the fibest of bothfl is important because our engineers recognize that there are synergies between integrated and eaf technology that must be capitalized upon if steel production is to achieve truly meaningful carbon reduction what is not new at u s steel however is our recognition of the tremendous role our iconic company has played in society and our responsibility to ensure that it endures for future generations to realize this future u s steel will continue to adapt and transform so it remains a pillar of our communities a source of pride for our employees and the bedrock of sustainable
