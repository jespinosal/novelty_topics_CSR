share a deeply felt purpose to improve the lives of consumers in every part of the world one important way in which we fulfill this purpose is through our commitment to the concept of sustainable development or sustainability which we believe is integral to both pgos future business success and to a truly better quality of life for all the worldos consumers now and for generations to come sustainability is an important way for us to leverage the power of innovation and global markets for the benefit of everyone not just those in the developed world we cannot condemn developing countries to a life of poverty so those in the developed world can maintain their lifestyles but neither do we have to presume that the only alternative is for the developed world to reduce its quality of life when we concede to such a notion we erect barriers to progress we pit the developed and developing worlds against one another and create an adversarial environment in which there are opposing sides not common purpose as a result progress stalls or moves only incrementally and twothirds of the worldos population continues to live on the fringes of existence there is an alternative it is based on the premise that we can make markets work for everyone and ultimately make lives better in every part of the world in this report you will find many examples of pgos contributions to a better quality of life through the creation of new products new markets and addressing new consumer needs for example pregnancy education to reduce maternal mortality actonel for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis dental hygiene education to improve oral health a partnership with unicef to combat tuberculosis another important issue we would like to address is how the global economic environment has impacted our business fiscal was a difficult year for pg and for its many employees around the world a strong plan was put in place to reestablish the balance between topline revenue growth and bottomline earnings growth however over the past fiscal year we continued to face a challenging economic environment with a slowing us economy and the possibility of a recession key economies around the globe were also slowing japan some countries in europe some of the developing markets in order to restore pgos ability to compete more effectively and to grow more consistently the previous restructuring program was expanded to further reduce overhead costs resulting in staffing reductions across the company when downsizing becomes necessary as it did this past fiscal year we manage employee separations in ways that are consistent with our values and principles we maintain focus and priority on our strong commitment to the diversity of our organization pg uses a voluntary separation program to maximize voluntary attrition the program which includes severance pay based on years of service continuation of health care benefits for the severance period outplacement support services and a retraining allowance provides a bridge for separating employees to retirement or employment elsewhere these efforts have translated into improved competitiveness by controlling costs and managing cash more effectively and resulted in getting pgos business back on track and growing again weove refocused on our biggest brands in our biggest markets with our biggest customers weove strengthened the value of our brands for consumers weove made strategic choices about which businesses pg should be in and which it should not we have only just started down our road to sustainable development but already we can see how pg benefits when we improve the lives of the worldos consumers now and for generations to come a g lafley president and chief executive john e pepper chairman of the board ceo and chairmanos statement f rom the beginning pgos embrace of sustainable development has been based on our vision that we can grow the business shareholder and stakeholder value of pg by bringing to the marketplace innovations and technologies that address the frustrations and aspirations of consumers at all levels of the economic pyramid since then we have been on a steep learning curve in our attempt to bring sustainability to life for our business managers as well as our external stakeholders i want to share some of our learnings with you our first and most important learning came in our efforts to define the concept of sustainability as a way to ensure better quality of life for everyone now and for generations to come this is an effort on which we have been focused for two years and we are encouraged by how many people in business government and nongovernmental organizations are not only embracing this concept but also seizing upon it to pursue common solutions and not just common problems people relate to the idea of a obetter quality of lifeo at an emotional level they have their own ideas about what a better quality of life means for them and their children and for those less fortunate than themselves at pg we now use this definition exclusively our second learning was the importance of talking about sustainability as an opportunity not an issue to be managed we recognized this difference and developed our approach to sustainability accordingly when meeting with our business leaders to discuss how sustainable development relates to their businesses we stress the opportunity that flows from oensuring a better quality of lifeo when talking with external stakeholders we share ideas on how to improve lives we find people begin talking about creative solutions new partnerships and new business opportunities that come from addressing the aspirations and problems of consumers all over the world however as we focus on building new topline value for pg we have maintained our historical attention to how we run our business our health safety and environmental management product safety programs and community relations efforts in this yearos report you will see pgos environmental compliance and employee safety performance are at historical best levels pg was rated the no company in the non cyclical consumer products sector by the dow jones sustainability group index business ethics magazine rated pg first in its annual list of best corporate citizens our approach to sustainability is a simple but enormously motivating way to think about our responsibility as a company it is fully consistent with our purpose values and principles thus a perfectly natural way for us to behave living up to such a challenge can be difficult but it is a challenge we embrace and we are pleased to share our progress with you george d carpenter director corporate sustainable development vision statement of purpose we will provide products and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the worldos consumers as a result consumers will reward us with leadership sales profit and value

consumers now and for generations to come sustainability is an important way for us to leverage the power of innovation and global markets for the benefit of everyone not just those in the developed world we cannot condemn developing countries to a life of poverty so those in the developed world can maintain their lifestyles but neither do we have to presume that the only alternative is for the developed world to reduce its quality of life when we concede to such a notion we erect barriers to progress we pit the developed and developing worlds against one another and create an adversarial environment in which there are opposing sides not common purpose as a result progress stalls or moves only incrementally and twothirds of the worldos population continues to live on the fringes of

examples of pgos contributions to a better quality of life through the creation of new products new markets and addressing new consumer needs for example pregnancy education to reduce maternal mortality actonel for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis dental hygiene education to improve oral health a partnership with unicef to combat tuberculosis another important issue we would like to address is how the global economic environment has impacted our business fiscal was a difficult year for pg and for its many employees around the world a strong plan was put in place to reestablish the balance between topline revenue growth and bottomline earnings growth however over the past fiscal year we continued to face a challenging economic environment with a slowing us economy and the possibility of a recession key economies around the globe were also slowing japan some countries in europe some of the developing markets in order to restore pgos ability to compete more effectively and to grow more consistently the previous restructuring program was expanded to further reduce overhead costs resulting in staffing reductions across the company when downsizing becomes necessary as it did this past fiscal year we manage employee separations in ways that are consistent with our values and principles we maintain focus and priority on our strong commitment to the diversity of our organization pg uses a voluntary separation program to maximize voluntary attrition the program which includes severance pay based on years of service continuation of health care benefits for the severance period outplacement support services and a retraining allowance provides a bridge for separating employees to retirement or employment elsewhere these efforts have translated into improved competitiveness by controlling costs and managing cash more effectively and resulted in getting pgos business back on track and growing again weove refocused on our biggest

some of our learnings with you our first and most important learning came in our efforts to define the concept of sustainability as a way to ensure better quality of life for everyone now and for generations to come this is an effort on which we have been focused for two years and we are encouraged by how many people in business government and nongovernmental organizations are not only embracing this concept but also seizing upon it to pursue common solutions and not just common problems people relate to the idea of a obetter quality of lifeo at an emotional level they have their own ideas about what a better quality of life means for them and their children and for those less fortunate than themselves at pg we now use this definition exclusively our second learning was the importance of talking about sustainability as an opportunity not an issue to be managed we recognized this difference and developed our approach to sustainability accordingly when meeting with our business leaders to discuss how sustainable development relates to their businesses we stress the opportunity that flows from oensuring a better quality of lifeo when talking with external stakeholders we share ideas on how to improve lives we find people begin talking about creative solutions new partnerships and new business opportunities that come from addressing the aspirations and

a i n a b i l i t y r e p o r t e x e c u t i v e s u m m a r y t he men and women of pg share a deeply felt purpose to improve the lives of consumers in every part of the world one important way in which we fulfill this purpose is through our commitment to the concept of sustainable development or sustainability which we believe is integral to both pgos future business success and to a truly better quality of life for all the worldos consumers now and for generations to come sustainability is an important way for us to leverage the power of innovation and global markets for the benefit of everyone not just those in the developed world we cannot condemn developing countries to a life of poverty so those in the developed world can maintain their lifestyles but neither do we have to presume that the only alternative is for the developed world to reduce its quality of life when we concede to such a notion we erect barriers to progress we pit the developed and developing worlds against one another and create an adversarial environment in which there are opposing sides not common purpose as a result progress stalls or moves only incrementally and twothirds of the worldos population continues to live on the fringes of existence there is an alternative it is based on the premise that we can make markets work for everyone and ultimately make lives better in every part of the world in this report you will find many examples of pgos contributions to a better quality of life through the creation of new products new markets and addressing new consumer needs for example pregnancy education to reduce maternal mortality actonel for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis dental hygiene education to improve oral health a partnership with unicef to combat tuberculosis another important issue we would like to address is how the global economic environment has impacted our business fiscal was a difficult year for pg and for its many employees around the world a strong plan was put in place to reestablish the balance between topline revenue growth and bottomline earnings growth however over the past fiscal year we continued to face a challenging economic environment with a slowing us economy and the possibility of a recession key economies around the globe were also slowing japan some countries in europe some of the developing markets in order to restore pgos ability to compete more effectively and to grow more consistently the previous restructuring program was expanded to further reduce overhead costs resulting in staffing reductions across the company when downsizing becomes necessary as it did this past fiscal year we manage employee separations in ways that are consistent with our values and principles we maintain focus and priority on our strong commitment to the diversity of our organization pg uses a voluntary separation program to maximize voluntary attrition the program which includes severance pay based on years of service continuation of health care benefits for the severance period outplacement support services and a retraining allowance provides a bridge for separating employees to retirement or employment elsewhere these efforts have translated into improved competitiveness by controlling costs and managing cash more effectively and resulted in getting pgos business back on track and growing again weove refocused on our biggest brands in our biggest markets with our biggest customers weove strengthened the value of our brands for consumers weove made strategic choices about which businesses pg should be in and which it should not we have only just started down our road to sustainable development but already we can see how pg benefits when we improve the lives of the worldos consumers now and for generations to come a g lafley president and chief executive john e pepper chairman of the board ceo and chairmanos statement f rom the beginning pgos embrace of sustainable development has been based on our vision that we can grow the business shareholder and stakeholder value of pg by bringing to the marketplace innovations and technologies that address the frustrations and aspirations of consumers at all levels of the economic pyramid since then we have been on a steep learning curve in our attempt to bring sustainability to life for our business managers as well as our external stakeholders i want to share some of our learnings with you our first and most important learning came in our efforts to define the concept of sustainability as a way to ensure better quality of life for everyone now and for generations to come this is an effort on which we have been focused for two years and we are encouraged by how many people in business government and nongovernmental organizations are not only embracing this concept but also seizing upon it to pursue common solutions and not just common problems people relate to the idea of a obetter quality of lifeo at an emotional level they have their own ideas about what a better quality of life means for them and their children and for those less fortunate than themselves at pg we now use this definition exclusively our second learning was the importance of talking about sustainability as an opportunity not an issue to be managed we recognized this difference and developed our approach to sustainability accordingly when meeting with our business leaders to discuss how sustainable development relates to their businesses we stress the opportunity that flows from oensuring a better quality of lifeo when talking with external stakeholders we share ideas on how to improve lives we find people begin talking about creative solutions new partnerships and new business opportunities that come from addressing the aspirations and problems of consumers all over the world however as we focus on building new topline value for pg we have maintained our historical attention to how we run our business our health safety and environmental management product safety programs and community relations efforts in this yearos report you will see pgos environmental compliance and employee safety performance are at historical best levels pg was rated the no company in the non cyclical consumer products sector by the dow jones sustainability group index business ethics magazine rated pg first in its annual list of best corporate citizens our approach to sustainability is a simple but enormously motivating way to think about our responsibility as a company it is fully consistent with our purpose values and principles thus a perfectly natural way for us to behave living up to such a challenge can be difficult but it is a challenge we embrace and we are pleased to share our progress with you george d carpenter director corporate sustainable development vision statement of purpose we will provide products and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the

pgcomsr for the full report pg sustainability report executive summary a g lafleyos statement there are two important things to know about procter gamble first the consumer is boss our business is based on this simple idea when we deliver to consumers the benefits weove promised when we provide a delightful and memorable usage experience when we make everyday life a little bit better a little easier a little bit healthier and safer then we begin to earn the trust on which great brands are built sustaining that trust requires an even greater commitment because improving lives is not a onetime event nor is it a onedimensional challenge we must provide products and services that meet the needs of consumers around the world while always fulfilling pgos responsibilities as a corporate citizen second pg is committed to staying in the lead our people are leaders our brands are leaders we have a culture that embraces leadership and that leadership culture drives not only business results but also the way we think about social responsibility and sustainability we look for opportunities where others see only responsibility we think and plan for the long term our respect for consumers and our commitment to leadership are reflected in our financial performance through clear strategic choices operational excellence and financial discipline we are returning to the consistent reliable earnings and cash growth that shareholders expect from our company these results are getting pg back in the lead and are also allowing us to move forward on longerterm initiatives that we believe may help address crucial global problems such as waterborne disease sanitation clean water womenos health dental hygiene and childhood nutrition historically pg has marketed its products to more affluent consumers predominantly in developed markets many of these longerterm efforts are focused on consumers in the developing world consumers with the same expectations for quality of life but who have far less purchasing power this presents new challenges we must often rethink fundamental assumptions about how we create manufacture distribute and market new products we must find creative new ways to help improve the lives of consumers at many different income levels in many diverse and different parts of the world we are doing this in several developing countries we are experimenting to find the best ways to make beneficial products such as nutristar available to families no matter how challenging their economic circumstances may be sustainability challenges are not limited to the developing world of course we are also focused on using the same kind of thinking to improve lives and build pgos business in developed markets one example is our actonel prescription drug for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis which is already a million brand and growing another example is the use of causerelated marketing to build sales of established brands in developed countries while also generating significant contributions to help address problems such as tuberculosis and childrenos education in developing countries my key point is that we must take seriously our responsibility to help raise and sustain quality of life everywhere pg does business we recognize that fulfilling this responsibility is quite simply fulfilling the purpose to which generations of pg people have aspired it is a responsibility we embrace with the same innovative spirit operating discipline and dogged determination to lead that have characterized this company for years we will not let up a g lafley chairman of the board president and chief executive pg sustainability report executive summary vision pg continues to embrace sustainable development as a business strategy as well as a corporate responsibility we believe we can grow our business and deliver evergreater shareholder and stakeholder value by bringing innovations to the marketplace that address the frustrations and aspirations of consumers at all economic levels strategically this has led us to focus on water health and hygiene as the areas that most relate to our brands and core competencies as we enter our fourth year of pursuing this strategy we are now moving from theory to reality from concepts to the marketplace and our belief is stronger than ever that we can make breakthrough contributions in childrenos nutrition and development safe drinking water and the reduction of waterborne disease these are areas of global importance around the world children are suffering from micronutrient deficiencies of iron vitamin a and iodine in their diets the longterm impact is striking a quarter million children go blind each year workforce iqs are often to points lower in areas where these dietary deficiencies are present rates of stillbirths and impaired learning and development are exponentially higher than in other parts of the world last fall pg entered the venezuelan market with nutristar a fortified drink mix that has been proven through clinical studies to correct micronutrient deficiency while our market experience is still limited and we have much yet to learn we are encouraged by consumerso response to the product and by our results to date in validating our sustainable development business model the coming year will see the launch of other initiatives in all our work to date we have come to appreciate more than ever that addressing issues of water health and hygiene is not something we can do alone partnerships have been and remain integral to our sustainable development efforts we partnered with the us centers for disease control to conduct clinical studies on waterborne disease in guatemala we joined forces with unicef to launch a marketing initiative that is funding tuberculosis vaccinations for million children in several developing countries we worked with the american academy of pediatrics to educate parents on
